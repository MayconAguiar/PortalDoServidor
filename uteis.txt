Some plugins may encounter incompatibilities due to new updates of Android Support Libraries as explained in other replies here.

Easiest fix is by installing "cordova-android-support-gradle-release" plugin. This plugin will automatically align the version of the plugin which crashed and you can continue to use your plugin.

Also this fix is persistent compared with manually change the version directly into the plugin.

cordova plugin add cordova-android-support-gradle-release --fetch
